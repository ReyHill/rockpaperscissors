        TO DO:
        ISSUE: Inputs are only accepted once, as opposed to five times. Results in the console only logging the outcome of the first iteration.  
        RESEARCH: Discover how to seperate game instances so the player and computer are given five seperate opportunities to input a choice instead of just one. 
        CODING: Write playGame(), which calls playRound() five times - try using a for loop. Remember to call PlayGame() at bottom of script. 
        CODING: Program a win counter that compares the total wins by both sides and returns string declaring the winner.
